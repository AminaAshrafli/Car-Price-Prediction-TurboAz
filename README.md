The data is gathered from Turbo.az and includes key attributes that influence the price, such as car specifications, city of listing, and seller information.

Key Features in the Dataset:
price_x, price_y: Car prices in different currencies.
currency_x, currency_y: The currencies used for the prices.
attributes: Information such as production year, engine size, mileage, etc.
city: City where the car is listed.
day, hour: Time details when the listing was posted.
vip, featured: Whether the listing is VIP or featured.
barter: Whether barter is accepted for the car.
loan: Whether the car is available for purchase via loan.
owner_name, shop_name: Names of the owner or the shop listing the car.

Model Training and Evaluation:
The data is split into training and testing sets, and different machine learning models are trained to predict car prices. The performance of the models is evaluated using common metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared (R¬≤).
